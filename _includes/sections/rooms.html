	<blockquote>The Pine Cone Inn is a totally charming place, with classic 1940s
		knotty-pine cuteness modernized for comfort. The hosts are a warm and
		welcoming arty couple who have done a tasteful job updating the amenities
		without making it kitschy or too slick. Cosy atmosphere, comfortable bed,
		deluxe linens, classic pink-tiled shower (so cute!), tasteful decor,
		in a location close to everything. I loved this place and the kind,
		cheery hosts, who made me and my pet feel valued and well-taken-care of.
